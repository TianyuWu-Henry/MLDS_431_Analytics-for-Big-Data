Here are the Linux shell scripts for Tasks 3 - 8.

Task 3: Create a new folder named **hw1** in Hadoop

```
hdfs dfs -mkdir hw1
```

Task 4: Move one file that you have just uploaded to Wolf to the new folder in Hadoop

Task 5: Rename this file in Hadoop

Task 6: Copy this file from Hadoop to the local filesystem

Task 7: Create a second folder in Hadoop. Copy two small text files to it. Then extract from Hadoop a single file that is going to be the concatenation of the two files, i.e., appending one file to the other one. (use getmerge)

Task 8: Take a different file on your local filesystem, move it to Hadoop, and then within Hadoop copy the same file to Tuckerâ€™s folder (/user/ml057868)
